## Project: Toronto's Traffic Accident Analysis

### Context
Toronto is a metropolis with a huge volume of traffic.  Accidents take place everyday. Studying underlying patterns that connect the traffic collisions with the surroundings (weather, time, road conditions, etc.) can provide us with better insights to help reduce the numbers of accidents.

### Objectives
Leverage Big Data tools to discover the relationships between Toronto's numbers of accidents and types of injury versus daylight condition, visibility, road condition, and vehicle types.

### Result Overview
1. Most accidents happened at `day` and `night`, but more serious injuries take place at `dawn` and `dusk`.
2. Among the types, `major injuries` are the most frequent (compared to `minor`, `minimal`, `no` or `fatal injury`).
3. `Minor injuries` were more likely to occur under `snowy condition`.

And there are more intriguing findings which can be found in this repo's directories.

These results could be a baseline for further research to help reducing and mitigating accidents happening on Toronto's roads.
